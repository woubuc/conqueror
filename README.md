# Conqueror
A minimal, semi-interactive strategy game made for the LibGDX 48h game jam.

## Intro
The world is divided. The three kingdoms are at war, and all know that only one of them will emerge victorious.

## How to play
You play as the blue kingdom. Your goal is to conquer the entire visible territory.

In Conqueror, you don't control your army directly. Instead, every turn you'll have to issue new orders to make your army do what you want to. But be careful what you choose, because the enemies will change their tactics as well at the same time.

In between turns, the armies will expand their territory and attack each other, according to the given orders.

## State of the game
Unfortunately due to the limited time of the game jam, I didn't get around to implementing all of the orders, and the movement / attacking is a bit more barebones than I would've liked. But the basic concept is there.
